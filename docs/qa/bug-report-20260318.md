## Bugs Found (Visual / UX — from screenshot analysis)

### BUG-001: Export WAV button visual disabled state is too subtle ❌
- **Severity:** P1
- **Screenshot:** `test-screenshots/06c-export-disabled.png` vs `test-screenshots/06d-export-enabled.png`
- **Description:** When the Export dialog shows "0 clips ready across 0 tracks," the Export WAV button is programmatically disabled (test confirms `isDisabled()` returns true), but **visually the button looks nearly identical to the enabled state**. The disabled button is still blue with white text — it lacks clear visual differentiation (e.g., grayed out, lower opacity, desaturated). Users may think the button is clickable and wonder why nothing happens.
- **Expected:** Disabled button should be clearly grayed out or visually distinct.
- **Steps to reproduce:**
  1. Create a new empty project (no tracks)
  2. Press Cmd+Shift+E to open Export dialog
  3. Observe the "Export WAV" button — it appears clickable despite being disabled
- **Fix suggestion:** The CSS class `disabled:opacity-50` is applied but the visual difference is minimal on a dark theme. Consider using `disabled:opacity-30` or `disabled:bg-zinc-600 disabled:text-zinc-400`.

### BUG-002: Keyboard Shortcuts dialog content truncated — no scrollbar ❌
- **Severity:** P1
- **Screenshot:** `test-screenshots/04m-shortcuts-dialog.png`
- **Description:** The Keyboard Shortcuts dialog (opened with `?`) shows truncated content at the bottom. The "GENERATION" and "PANELS" sections are visible as headers but their content is cut off below the dialog boundary. There is **no visible scrollbar** to indicate more content exists below.
- **Expected:** Dialog should either be scrollable with a visible scrollbar, or resize to fit all content.
- **Steps to reproduce:**
  1. Create a new project
  2. Press `?` (Shift+/)
  3. Scroll down — GENERATION and PANELS sections are partially cut off

### BUG-003: Muted track has no visual dimming in arrangement area ❌
- **Severity:** P2
- **Screenshot:** `test-screenshots/05a-track-muted.png` vs `test-screenshots/05b-track-soloed.png`
- **Description:** When a track is muted, the mute button turns amber (correct), but the **track's arrangement lane (timeline area) shows no visual change** — no dimming, no opacity reduction, no desaturation. In contrast, when Solo is active on another track, non-soloed tracks correctly dim their track headers. This inconsistency means users can't tell at a glance which tracks are muted by looking at the arrangement.
- **Expected:** Muted tracks should have dimmed/reduced opacity in the arrangement area, consistent with how solo affects non-soloed tracks.
- **Steps to reproduce:**
  1. Create project with 3 tracks
  2. Click mute button on first track
  3. Observe: track header shows amber mute icon, but arrangement area is unchanged

### BUG-004: Status bar text extremely low contrast ❌
- **Severity:** P2
- **Screenshot:** All screenshots — `test-screenshots/01a-new-project-dialog.png` etc.
- **Description:** The status bar at the bottom of the app shows "Offline" with a red dot (left) and "ACE Studio" (right), but both text elements have extremely low contrast against the dark background. The text is nearly unreadable, especially when overlaid by modal dialogs.
- **Expected:** Status bar text should meet WCAG AA contrast ratio (4.5:1 for normal text).
- **Steps to reproduce:**
  1. Open the app
  2. Look at the bottom status bar
  3. Text is barely visible

### BUG-005: Track name truncation ("Percuss...") in narrow track list panel ❌
- **Severity:** P2
- **Screenshot:** `test-screenshots/02e-all-tracks.png`
- **Description:** With the default track list panel width, longer track names like "Percussion" are truncated to "Percuss..." with ellipsis. While truncation is expected at small widths, the default width should be wide enough to display standard track names without truncation.
- **Expected:** Default panel width should accommodate all standard instrument names (longest: "Backing Vocals" at ~14 chars).
- **Steps to reproduce:**
  1. Create project and add all track types including "Percussion"
  2. Observe track list — "Percussion" is truncated

### BUG-006: Mixer panel shows "Add tracks to see the mixer" while Master fader is visible ❌
- **Severity:** P2
- **Screenshot:** `test-screenshots/04b-mixer-toggle.png`
- **Description:** When the mixer panel is opened on an empty project (no tracks), the message "Add tracks to see the mixer" is displayed in the center area, while the **Master channel** with its fader is already visible on the left. This is contradictory — either the Master fader should be hidden too, or the message should read "Add tracks to see track channels" or similar.
- **Expected:** Consistent messaging — either hide Master fader and show "Add tracks" message, or show Master and update message text.

### BUG-007: Vite proxy errors for /health endpoint flooding server logs ❌
- **Severity:** P2
- **Screenshot:** N/A (server logs)
- **Description:** During all test runs, the dev server continuously logs `http proxy error: /health` with `ECONNREFUSED 127.0.0.1:8001`. This suggests the Vite config has a proxy rule forwarding `/health` requests to a backend at port 8001 that doesn't exist in local dev mode. These errors flood the server output (100+ per test run) making it hard to spot real errors.
- **Expected:** The health check proxy should be conditional (only in production), or the client should not ping `/health` when the backend is unavailable.
- **Steps to reproduce:**
  1. Run `npm run dev`
  2. Open browser to http://127.0.0.1:5174
  3. Observe server terminal — constant `/health` proxy errors

## Observations (Not Bugs)

1. **Audio context overlay works correctly** — "Click anywhere to enable audio" appears on first load and clears on click
2. **`__uiStore` not exposed on window** — Only `__store` (projectStore) is exposed. Test 3a tried to open piano roll via `__uiStore` but it wasn't available. This means UI-level testing of piano roll opening requires DOM clicks instead.
3. **Export with MIDI content works** — The "0 clips ready" counter only counts audio clips, not MIDI content. The Export WAV button correctly enables when MIDI notes exist (it renders them during export). The counter text could be clearer: "1 MIDI track + 0 audio clips ready" would be more informative.
4. **IndexedDB persistence** — Project persistence via IndexedDB works (zustand persist middleware). Between page reloads, the last project would be restored. Tests don't verify this since each test creates fresh state.

## Recommendations

1. **P0 (Fix immediately):** None — no show-stopping bugs found. The app is stable and functional.
2. **P1 (Fix before next release):**
   - BUG-001: Make disabled Export button clearly visually distinct
   - BUG-002: Add scroll to Keyboard Shortcuts dialog or make it responsive
3. **P2 (Fix in next sprint):**
   - BUG-003: Add visual dimming for muted tracks in arrangement
   - BUG-004: Improve status bar text contrast
   - BUG-005: Widen default track list panel or use smaller font
   - BUG-006: Fix mixer "Add tracks" message when Master is showing
   - BUG-007: Suppress health check proxy errors in dev mode
